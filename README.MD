# Temple Lean Fitness Gym

## Executive Summary 
The Temple Lean Gym website is designed for people who wish to access physical activity within the context of living with COVID-19. The Temple Lean owners had previously invested in a static website but when the pandemic hit this was deemed to be insufficient to meet the needs of the current business. A new website was needed to supply the members with online bookings for onsite activity and a new online platform to cater for completely online members.

The key membership categories the business wished to offer are below ;

1. Online 
2. Student
3. Corporate
4. Public

The class categories on offer are below ;

1. Kettlebells 
2. Pilates
3. Lean Machine (Our new bespoke Small Group Training class) 
4. HIIT

The problems that we are trying to solve for the owner are;  
1. Remodel the Temple Lean Business for living with COVID-19
2. Connect with members after lockdowns or whilst the lockdown is ongoing 
3. Provide the business with and effective means to conduct a large proportion of their business online

The problem that we are trying to solve for the service user are;
1. Our members have become more health conscious and wish to maintain the physical activity they enjoyed during lockdown. 
2. Our members wish to have less physical contacts whilst the Pandemic is ongoing. Offering online physical activity is seen by our members as a short to medium term solution during the pandemic. Allowing Temple Lean members to do more business with us virtually is also seen as stress free way to stay active.
3. Some of our service users are now exclusively online. We need to develop an initial offering for them into a consistent business. We will need to develop this over time possibly as an adjunct to main membership 


The above named membership and class categories are strategically valuable markets. They are what people want from a gym in the post COVID-19 21st century. 
We have designed the website to offer bitesize information on the best gym experience. 

The success of this website is that the user is able to locate the type of class/memebership/coach they want quickly and easily without having to sift through the large amount of information on the general web. 

Further success will be measured by the number of Temple Lean members who sign up and buy services from the Temple Lean website, create a profile, update their profile and delete a profile they no longer find useful. 
   

## UX

The key reasons for producing the website were to;

- help current gym members get the best quality physical activity experience from their trusted Health and Fitness professionals at Temple Lean Gym
- help members easily access 4 common membership categories and 4 common class categories
- help integrate new and current members into a community where they can
  - book services they use on their fitness journey
  - read their Temple Lean profile 
  - update their profile they have used themselves
  - delete their profile they no longer find useful  
- In the future help Temple Lean Gym attract and retain online subscription members through their website 

At the outset the minimum viable product was determined to be a community platform whereby the operator(s) of the Temple Lean Gym website 
 - add a source of basic information about Temple Lean services
 - begin to build a digital support platform for Temple Lean members in a Lifestyle and Physical Activity context.
 - begin to build a digital support platform to help Temple Lean owners run their Business effectively with respect to the challenges of today.

It was an objective of this project to include an intuitive design which would allow new and current clients to navigate and engage with the website without any prior experience of Temple Lean the gym facility or it's online services. 
Current and potential client surveys were conducted to assess the minumim effective information required to illicit a positive emotional response from users.
This information was incredibly valuable during the construction of wireframes for the website. 


At the outset conventional web design features such Navbar, Footer, shopping bag and checkout were favoured because we wanted everyone from the novice to the accompolished web user to feel like they were still in a familiar place on the web. 

The vision for the project was to have a website that;

- Delivered basic information that the user could read about Temple Leans online services and on site facilities 
- Offer a route to purchase access to the services

Further objectives included;
- implementing interactive features on the Temple Lean website to help the user feel they were receiving a comprehensive service.

It was determined that the Minimum Viable Product will contain the essential features below;
- Register
- Log in Log Out
- CRUD a profile
- Allow the owner the CRUD to manage products
- Buy Class Pass
- Buy Membership
- Find information about Facilities and Coaches

## Business Model

### Strategy Plan

What are you the Business aiming to achieve? 
- Users are looking for; 
  - A place to workout in a post/living with COVID-19 era
  - A place to enjoy a workout in the gym whilst feeling safe or online if in a temporary lockdown
  - Access to Small Group Training
  - A place they can book a class or purchase membership online
- As a business we are looking to provide the above to our members


Business wants the client to;
 - Access Temple Lean services easily 
 - Build an effective relationship with our clients online

Review the competition - Is someone else already doing it?
- A review of the market in Cork Ireland suggested that a platform for members to access physical activity services within a Health and Fitness Clubs website was a new or under developed idea
- A review of the businesses below showed that many fitness providers had an app to manage classes but that membership and classes appeared to be seperated between the app and the website.
- We looked towards everything in one place to avoid user frustration with looking for membership on an app exclusively designed for classes or worse no information at all telling the users that membership was only available via the front desk
- Businesses reviewed
   - https://www.mardykearena.com/
   - https://www.dennehys.ie/
   - https://www.energiefitness.com/midleton
   - https://onelifefitness.ie/
   - https://gymplus.ie/locations/cork/
- Businesses reviewed online

Stakeholder interviews
- An emerging trend in Fitness clubs and studios prior to the pandemic was the Small Group Training

Who else is doing this?
- Small Group Training hadn't caught on as yet in Ireland though the market elsewhere indicated a willingness to access and pay a high premium for this service. Reference https://www.ihrsa.org/improve-your-club/why-personal-small-group-training-is-for-everyone/
- Few studios were offering this class and thus this was identified as a unique selling point in our Business Strategy. 
- Our classes were thus capped at a maximum of 12 members
- An online class service was developed as a route for the potential overflow of members
- It was forecast that the demand for these small group training environments would rise as people continue to seek out opportunities to minimise contacts after COVID-19 subsided 

What are the pros of what we're offering?
- Online exercise and coaching has proliferated since the onset of the pandemic. It will be essential to the survival business that we offer clients the option of online exercise services and the ability to book online for onsite facilities
- The business through small group training offers the user the opportunity for a safer and more personalised physical activity service

What are the cons?
- The older generation have found it difficult to navigate the online world.
- Moving exercise programmes online has very little precedent to follow.
- Although small group training is forecast as the way to go high quality is also expected. Upskilling staff will be neccessary

What are the competition missing?
- The connectivity this area offers
- The software development expertise to carry out this functionality with an intuitive user friendly feel
- They also appear to be reluctant to offer small group training favouring the traditional model of large class numbers at a low cost. This maybe prohibited for some time into the future

What are they (the competition) doing, but they could be doing better?
- They are providing the facility and knowledge to particpate in regular exercise relative to COVID-19 health and safety expectations
- They aren't offering direct sign up and online payments in a lot of cases. The offering is fragmented and spread across multiple systems
- They aren't developing their business to serve a growing online user market


User interviews and Surveys (What a user thinks they need may not be exactly what they need?)
- Majority wanted basic classes and membership to return to something familiar. If we offered something online the user wanted it to feel familiar. In others words if they had public or student membership before they wanted to be offered public membership again but online
- Some of the feedback was conflicting. Some clients wanted more advanced niche products like Strength and Conditioning, marathon, triathlon and nutrition training classes.
- We reduced our offering to a basic physical activity offering to avoid cluttering our initial move into the online world for the user. Also with no competitive sport on the horizon we felt the Strength and Conditioning, marathon, triathlon and nutrition training classes might be unsuccessful and fail. They were placed in future development 
- The majority of feedback from client surveys indicated a balance of Cardiovascular and Resistance training offers would be broadly welcomed. 
- Feedback which led us to include pilates in our service offer came from clients who were now reporting that they were sitting down working from home and their core strength was severely diminshed.
- Pilates was seen as an essential rehab route for our clients and possibly a way to build them back up to Strength and Conditioning, marathon and triathlon training classes
- The conclusion the developer drew from these interviews was that we should start basic and progress to more advanced activity recommendations if a clear market or demand emerged later. 

Would you use this and why? 
- Yes I as the developer would use it because it offers me a way to manage my physical activity online
- Clients indicated they would use it because they wished to be able to continue their healthy lifestyle even if another lockdown occurs.
- They welcomed the opportunity to manage their membership and class bookings in a way that suits them

Who is our target audience? 
- This project is primarily a consumer business to customer service (B2C) 
- We noted the potential for business to business B2B partnerships and included some corporate team offerings. Rather than opt for a bespoke offering to each potential corporate client we went with a scattergun approach to assess where the corporate wellness market is in the COVID-19 era. Feedback will reveal where bespoke offerings maybe included 
- Our aim was to access clients we already have but leave the door open for other clients to join us 
- Our thoughts were that our current clients wouldn't need much justifcation to purchase a their previous offering online from us given our existing relationship and the trust we have built up over many years.

What makes a good Fitness Facility website experience?
- Following reserach we settled on the points below as a good Gym website experience
  - Intuitive design (Simple Navigation)
  - Clean, attractive layout with point and clicks revealing information slowly in an easy to understand readable format
  - Users can create, read, update and delete their own profile and interact with Temple Lean 
  - Videos (This was placed in future development plans)
  - Pricing transparent (3 step purchase preferable) 


### Scope Plane 
Features we wanted to include in our design

Color Scheme
- Colour light background generally white then strong font and color
- The color scheme that was used in this website came from the followin recommendations on this website https://colors.muz.li/
- The developer searched for the color light blue in the website above. We then implemented that color into the project home page as a test to see how it looked. We reviewed with friends and family and relative to other gyms. We then serached for a color palette that went with #80C4FF. This guided us colors through out the site such as button colors for the CRUD features. All colors were associated with the recommendations of this color palette
- We reviewed the following websites to help us determine a color and scheme and what to avoid in design
  - http://www.kabu-kitamura.com/colon/en/ 
    - Review notes what not to do annoying music and no intuitive way to get to gym information
  - https://mountainsoulyoga.com/classes/ 
    - Review notes grey color not great
  - https://yogabuzz.org/ 
    - Review notes color blue Navbar #0000ff Alert #ff0000 Body #bfcfff Writing #ffffff

## Structure Plane
In development we set out to make sure that our site would be consistent. We used the categories below to describe our efforts
 - Predictable
   - We used a base template for the header and footer and a white overlay to cover the background image of the body
   - We used similar forms to register, to log in, create and update profile information, take payment information, create, update and delete information and product information if you're a super user.
   We used similar cards for each section of the site to help the user intuitively move around the site no matter what page they accessed
   - We used clear intuitive call to action buttons throughout the site to help user make a purchase easily  
   - We used Toast messages to tell the user that they have successfully completed a task or entered invalid information or tried to do something that only the owner of the site can do. The user will be able to rely on the site for feedback if they complete an action
 - Learnable
   - We used buttons and links reveal information to the user and guide user to the next step if they wished to make a purchase or visit another part of the site
   - Toast messages tell the user that they have successfully completed a task or entered invalid information or tried to do something that only the owner of the site can do 
 - Visible 
   - A user can easily review updates they have made on the site immediately after they have been made
   - In so far as we could we used photos and icons to give the user visible feedback like pictures, buttons, hover effect and icons about where they are on the site and what they can.   
 - Clear and intuitive feedback
   - Toast messages give clear and intuitive feedback to the user. Automatic emails sent from the developers gmail on sign up or purchase also reassure the user that they have proceeded with their desired intention.

### User Questions

- Where am I?
  - On each page the main Navbar highlights text in light green of the relevant page. This helps you locate where you are on the Temple Lean Recipes site. 
  - Subheaders on each page tell the user they are on a certain page ie Coaches which has information about , Membership and class has Activity Offers written on it and the Shopping Bag is called the Gym Bag and Checkout is also labelled. All of these are designed to give the user the experience of moving through a process.
  - 

- How did I get here?
  - Clicking on certain icons or words opens up new tabs to a specific external site so the user does not forget which website they accessed the content from such as social media platforms. The platforms are currently connected to the developers social media accounts because the social media accounts for this website and it's staff do not exist. Rather than leave any empty link the developer opted for his own social media pages to demonstrate in the skill of linking pages to thei site and to show the user a full web experience even whilst the site is undergoing business development. 
  - The navbar and footer are the exact same on each page and with the current page highlighted in light green in the main navbar so that the user may easily identify where they are on the Temple Lean website
  - The keeping shopping and cancel buttons act as a way for the user go back a step if they need too amend something or if they go forward by mistake without pressing the back button. The user can also press click on Temple lean which acts as a home button on large screens. A door icon acts as a dropdown menu on a small screen to help users see which page they are on in light green and will help reveal how they arrived on the page from another place on the site
  
- What can I do here?
  - The user is invited clearly to click on and then access various features of the Temple Lean  website. 
  - This occurs in the following places;
     - Navbar with the hover feature
     - Footer via the social media icons (Hover feature turns them light green when the cursor is over the icons)
     - The Update and Delete buttons with their icons clearly represent a function the user may undertake
     - On click the dropdown feature in the main navbar reveals subnavigation for that particular section 
     - The user is also invited to type information on forms and into the search bar throughout the site. This form information is requested via placeholder and single clear words for example update or sign in or logout let the user know what they can do here or what will happen here.

- Where can I go from here?
  - The navbar and footer are the exact same on each page. In the navbar the user is able to easily identify where they are using the light blue active feature and where they can go from here is not highlighted letting the user know that they can go here if they wish. 
  - Buttons also tell the user intuitively where they can go from here ie update profile or Buy membership, Secure Checkout or complete Order
  - The blue hover feature is also designed to indicate to the user that they can click on this icon in the footer and access further content.
  - On the home page in the cards (under the main hero image) the Log In and Register Page buttons invite the user to click on them and log in or register.

- Header - Contains the Navbar design for desktop and mobile devices 
- Easy navigation - The Navbar at the top of each page is similar to conventional navbars of other recipe pages allowing the user an intuitive experience on a perhaps unfamiliar website. We maintained this navbar across each page using a base template for ease of navigation and coding. The top part of the navbar including log in and registeration collapse on a mobile device to a single apple icon which the user can click on. The navbar items Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and Snacks appear after you register or log in. This was done to avoid overhwleming the user when they land on the page and guide them to log in or register and then more content will be revealed.

#### Bugs

Bug - Product Detail page
- In the product detail page the has days feature was visibly too close to the Quantity incrementor. To push to down we inserted a top margin or mt-2 in Day column which pushed it down. This made the product details page more visibly appealing.
- The column in the select box went from this code <div class="col-12"> to this code <div class="col-12 mt-3"> to solve the problem

Bug - Home page
- Get Lean Now button
- On the home page the GET LEAN NOW Button would wrap around itself and look terrible on mobile devices
- sample photo of the problem can be seen here readmedoc2/bugphotos/getleanbuttonerror.jpg
- To fix the error the wrapping div column was changed from col-7 to col-12. The fix can be seen here readmedoc2/bugphotos/getleanbuttonfixed.jpg
- The div code before
    - <div class="col-7 col-md-6 my-auto">
- The div code after 
    -  <div class="col-12 col-md-6 my-auto">

Bug - Add product urls

Correct code 
  path('<int:product_id>/', views.product_detail, name='product_detail'),
Developer wrote by accident 
   path('<int:product_id/, views.product_detail, name='product_detail'),

Bug - Coaches view
- context = {
        'coaches':coaches,
    }
versus
- context = {
        coaches:'coaches',
    }

Bug - images set to 250 px
taregtting css classes .card-img, .card-img-top with height 250 px would not render. Targeting the img element did. Did have to change some images as the looked stretched 

Bug - Directory Structure wrong in Facilities app
- facilities on top of template instead of template on top of facilities

Bug - Visual- Pictures 
- Button primary class overwriting hover
- Home page Picture not rendering quite as effectively on the screen 

Bugs - input data postgres to sqlite

Bugs - css for home button changed nav and footer so bottom css was not working at all

Bugs - data delay into Toast Header div and not container div

Bugs - bag tools in checkout template or template error showed. Forgot to add bag tools at the top

Bugs - checkout app missing div caused footer to loose the outer edge of it's blue. inserted code into validator and found missing div

Bugs - countries field navigate through model and forms removed the label. Changing the css height in StripeElement,
.stripe-style-input to 60 px resolved the image problem
